# Live-Scribbling-Echo-Digi-Pen

This Project focuses on “QUALITY EDUCATION” which helps in enhancing lives of
handicapped people.
1. People who are mute will get a voice to express their emotions through writing.
2. People who are more interested in what someone is teaching him in school or
college rather than making notes of the what he is teaching can help them to get
those notes easily through Digi-pen.
3. Audio commands will help the blind people to learn how to write alphabets in
English instead of Braille.
